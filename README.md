# automate-real-world-tasks
Work for the Coursera Automating Real-World tasks with Python class. This is the final course in the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate.

The work in this repo is the pre-lab work and consists of prototypes of the code that I implemented in the Qwicklabs platform that was used for the final tests.
